# King County Housing Market Insights
Using data to decide whether to buy a house, and when to sell it.

## Summary
This project aimed to provide a complete, data-driven business solution to answer two very common questions in the housing market through exploratory data analysis (EDA) - which properties should the company buy and how long should the company wait before selling them?     

An online dashboard was developed to give the company an overview of the properties available to be part of the company's portfolio with attribute filters, maps with the distribution of the properties, key statistics, the main insights from the exploratory analysis, and the expected profit from suggested properties for purchase.
